# Mix-in module that provides services to manage a multiplicity attribute.
# Internally, the multiplicities are represented as symbolic values.
# However client code can use alternative multiplicity syntaxes that are more user-readable.
# Requirements:
# Classes that mix-in this module are required to have a constant named ForbiddenMultiplicities
module Repeating

	Many = 987654

	Multiplicities = [ :none, :zero_or_one, :one, :zero_or_more, :one_or_more ]

	# The multiplicity is the possible number of occurrences. Must be one of symbolic value defined in the Multiplicities constant.
